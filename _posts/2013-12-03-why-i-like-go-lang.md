I was asked once by [https://github.com/jjperezaguinaga](https://github.com/jjperezaguinaga):
```
I am of the impression that you have a strong love fan for Go.
What's so cool about it? I'm kind of curious.
```

So here are my anwsers:

* easy to learn: [http://tour.golang.org](http://tour.golang.org) took me about 15 hours to complete (with browsing documentation)

* language is easy and minimalistic

* awesome standard library

* awesome community

* easy and awesome concurrency model

* suitable for system task

* kind of C replacement

* language for solving interesting problems* easier than never before

* xml and json as native type

* everything you would do in C you can do in Go without language overhead (no more leaking memory, pointers headaches, header files)

*interesting problems for me are:

* http tools (proxies, traffic catchers etc)

* ssh tunnels

* network solution

* managing cloud (deploying, scheduling, etc)

* alghoritms
