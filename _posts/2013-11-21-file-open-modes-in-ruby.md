Since I don't use file opening to often in ruby, I am writing them down here:

```
Mode |  Meaning
  -----+--------------------------------------------------------
  "r"  |  Read-only, starts at beginning of file  (default mode).
  -----+--------------------------------------------------------
  "r+" |  Read-write, starts at beginning of file.
  -----+--------------------------------------------------------
  "w"  |  Write-only, truncates existing file
       |  to zero length or creates a new file for writing.
  -----+--------------------------------------------------------
  "w+" |  Read-write, truncates existing file to zero length
       |  or creates a new file for reading and writing.
  -----+--------------------------------------------------------
  "a"  |  Write-only, starts at end of file if file exists,
       |  otherwise creates a new file for writing.
  -----+--------------------------------------------------------
  "a+" |  Read-write, starts at end of file if file exists,
       |  otherwise creates a new file for reading and
       |  writing.
  -----+--------------------------------------------------------
   "b" |  Binary file mode (may appear with
       |  any of the key letters listed above).
       |  Suppresses EOL <-> CRLF conversion on Windows. And
       |  sets external encoding to ASCII-8BIT unless explicitly
       |  specified.
  -----+--------------------------------------------------------
   "t" |  Text file mode (may appear with
       |  any of the key letters listed above except "b").
```
